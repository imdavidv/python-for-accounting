#### Similar to example1 for Bank Reconciliation, but instead of 'BankRec_example.xlsx,' I will access the SQL database directly.
###### Accessing the table directly removes an extra step for comparing the bank transactions.
###### Another option is to use the 'min' and 'max' function to find the smallest check number and largest check number in the bank transaction file. Then run the SQL query to only gather the data within the check range of the bank transactions.
