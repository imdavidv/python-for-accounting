# Bank Reconciliaiton With Two Excel Files

###### I used the Purchasing.PurchasingOrderHeader table from the AdventureWorks2017 database from microsoft. 
###### I modified the purchase order to represent a check number and exported to an excel file called 'BankRec_example.xlsx'
###### I also selected a random sample from 'BankRec_example.xlsx' and created a version of what a bank's file would look like. I exported it as an excel file 'BankRec_BankofAmerica.xlsx' 
###### I will use the 'BankRec_example.xlsx' and 'BankRec_BankofAmerica.xlsx' to review daily bank transactions.
